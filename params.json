Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n- Apache Maven \r\n- Java JDK 7\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nmvn clean install package && cd target && java -jar superman-1.0.jar && cd ..\r\n\r\nBuild Status\r\n------------\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/palsuman/Project-Euler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/palsuman/Project-Euler)\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/palsuman/Project-Euler.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/palsuman/Project-Euler?branch=master)\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2014 Suman Pal\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\n\ta copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\t\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\n\twithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\n\tdistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\n\tpermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\n\tthe following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n\tincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n\tEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\n\tMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n\tNONINFRINGEMENT.
